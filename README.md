This is a django appliaction. Which uses cryptographic algorithm to shorten the large urls. 

We can shorten the URL in two ways:
1. Generate a random 5 character URL.
2. Generate a customised short URL.

Every user will get to see his own urls in the dashboard.

This app keeps track of the usage of shortened urls.
